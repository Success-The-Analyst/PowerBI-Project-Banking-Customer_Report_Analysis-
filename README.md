# PowerBI-Project-Banking-Customer_Report_Analysis

## Overview

This Power BI project presents an analysis of banking customer data. The report provides insights into customer behavior, segmentations based on demographics, credit card ownership, and exit trends. The goal of this analysis is to help the bank identify patterns in customer behavior and make informed decisions to improve retention, engagement, and overall strategy.

## Key Analytics Sections:

1. **Total Customer Count**: Displays the total number of customers as well as their categorization based on whether they are active or inactive customers.

2. **Customer By Year and Active Category**: A bar chart that visualizes the number of active and inactive customers each year. This chart helps to identify trends in customer retention.

3. **Exit Customers and Previous Month Exit Customers by Month**: This chart displays the number of customers who left in a given month and compares it to the previous month’s exit customer data. This information helps in understanding customer churn over time.

4. **Exit Customers by Gender Category**: A pie chart that splits exit customers by gender, providing insights into how gender is correlated with customer churn.

5. **Exit Customers by Credit Score**: This bar chart categorizes exit customers based on their credit score, showing how the creditworthiness of exiting customers might affect the overall bank’s performance.

6. **Exit Customers by Category**: This pie chart divides exit customers into two categories: credit card holders and non-credit card holders, helping to understand which group is more prone to exit.

## Approach:

### Data Collection:
The data used for this report was gathered from the banking system, segmented by various demographics and customer characteristics. It includes key details about each customer’s activity, credit score, and monthly engagement.

### Data Transformation:
Data was cleaned and transformed in Power BI, where key metrics like the total number of customers, active/inactive statuses, exit rates, and segmentation details were calculated.

### Visualizations:
Power BI was used to create visually appealing dashboards to provide insights into customer behavior. Multiple charts were created to visualize the following:
- Active and inactive customer counts over time
- Trends of customer exits by month
- Demographic breakdown of exit customers by gender and credit score
- Segmentation of exit customers by credit card ownership

### Insights & Actions:
- **Customer Retention**: The report highlights months where customer exits spiked, suggesting possible reasons (e.g., external economic factors, product dissatisfaction).
- **Credit Score and Churn**: By analyzing exit customers' credit scores, the bank can identify if lower-credit score individuals tend to exit more frequently, prompting potential actions for improving relationships with this segment.
- **Demographics**: Gender and credit card ownership segments provide further granularity to analyze the likelihood of different customer groups exiting.

## How to Use:

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Open the **Banking Customer Report Analysis.pbix** file using **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Interact with the visualizations by selecting different filters for **Year**, **Month**, **Geography Location**, **Active Category**, **Exit Category**, and **Gender**.
